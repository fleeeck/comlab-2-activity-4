            <h1>Women with Baskets, Fish, and Crab</h1>
            <p>
                One of the beloved artworks of Anita Magsaysay-Ho, an acclaimed Filipino painter, was Women with Baskets, Fish, and Crab. She had prominently displayed it in her living room before giving it to one of her oldest friends. This painting beautifully combines a celebration of Filipino craftsmanship, the resilience of Filipina women, and the artistic talent and skill of the painter. The baskets in the painting represent the hard work and commitment that go into basket weaving, which Anita regarded as one of the most exquisite handicrafts in the Philippines.
